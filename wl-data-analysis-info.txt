Channels:
	- Time
	- Tension (Mean)
	- Tension (Time @ Maximum Value)
	- Tension (time @ minimum value)
	- Tension (value @ selection)
	- Length (maximum value)
	- Length (time at maximum)

	- Instantaneous Frequency (Mean)
	- Instantaneous Frequency (Max)

	- Event Marker

Rate of data should be @ every 0.05 seconds / 0.01 seconds.

Values for analysis:
	- Cumulative baseline average (resting discharge)
	- Individual baseline average (it is taking the average of an individual signal, 
	followed throughout the course of the baseline)

	(Instantaneous Frequency)
	- DP (Up Ramp)
	- IST (0.4 - 0.5 seconds)
	- FST (3.25 - 3.75 seconds)
	- Dyanamic Index (DI) (FST - IST)
	
	- Average 50 hz (vibrations)
	- Average 100 hx (vibrations)

	- A lot of the values recorded will be based off of the tension and instantaneous frequency channels & values.

Datapad columns:
	a. Time
	b. Instantaneous Frequency
	c. Length
	d. Tension
	e. OFF

=====================================

I propose that we stop using the spike histogram to determine the instantaneous frequency of our signal,
and instead turn to taking the data of our signal, and applying the hilbert transformation to it inside of our code.

This will completely automate the need to open the spike histogram software, and leave the computer to automate the work.

The spike histogram was actually used to identify where we had peak signal values. People then manually thumbed through those
values to determine which ones were actually valid signals. Since we will be using machine learning to figure out which of our 
signals are actually values, and in turn do not need to manually analyze valid signals, the use of the spike histogram becomes obsolete.


Datapad columns:
	a. Time (s)
	b. Channel 1 Amp (mV)
	c. Length (mm)
	d. Tension (mN)

We will be sampling the data every 0.05 seconds.
